## Description

This application creates a polished Readme file for your projects. 

I built this project to help users create readme files instead of typing them our themselves from scratch. Rather than typing a readme file from scratch and most readme files follow a template, this application prompts you to answer section questions and turns your user answers into a readme file. I learned how grab users` answers from generic question prompts and input them into a Readme file that follows markup formatting standard amongst Readme files.
